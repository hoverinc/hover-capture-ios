# HOVER Capture iOS SDK

The HOVER Capture iOS SDK provides a user flow for capturing and submitting 3D scans of homes to be processed by HOVER. This involves a camera experience capable of collecting all necessary data, and instructional and permission management flows to improve capture success rates.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Swift Package Manager
- Swift 5.9 (Xcode 15 or `swift-tools-version: 5.9`) or higher

### Swift Package Manager

The HOVER Capture iOS SDK is distributed using Swift Package Manager. You may integrate it using Xcode or a `Package.swift` file. 

<details>
<summary>Xcode</summary>
 
To integrate the SDK using Xcode, perform the following steps:

1. In the Xcode Project Navigator pane (on the left side), select your project.
2. Select your project under the PROJECT heading on the left-side panel
3. Select the Package Dependencies tab on the top
4. Click the + button under the Packages list.
5. In the "Search or Enter Package URL" search bar, enter the repository url (`https://github.com/hoverinc/hover-capture-ios.git`)
6. Click "Add Package"
7. Select a target to add the `HVCaptureSDK` library.

<summary>Package.swift</summary>
 
To integrate the SDK into a Swift package, add the following line to your `dependencies` array in your `Package.swift` manifest:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/hoverinc/hover-capture-ios.git", from: "2.0.0")
```

## Usage

The `Example` app in the repository provides a minimal example of how to integrate the SDK into an application. Additionally, the [Getting Stated](https://hoverinc.github.io/hover-capture-ios/documentation/hvcapturesdk/gettingstarted) guide and [Tutorials](https://hoverinc.github.io/hover-capture-ios/tutorials/tutorials/) have more comprehensive and up-to-date documentation regartding SDK usage, customization and integration.

### Initializing the SDK

The SDK should be initialized as early as possible in the app lifecycle. This is because the SDK does some background work to set up required structures and upload any remaining captured data from past jobs that have yet to complete.
As such, the SDK should (ideally) be initialized in host applicationâ€™s `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method, so that the SDK can continue uploading any files that remain to be uploaded. This helps expedite 3D model generation, as we need all the captured images and metadata to begin the 3D reconstruction process.

```swift
import HVCaptureSDK 
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    // ...

    @MainActor
    private func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        HVPartnerSDK.sharedInstance.initialize()
    }
}
```

### Creating a Capture Session

The host app can launch the SDK in any way it sees fit, as long as there is an active ViewController somewhere in the app. Here is one example using SwiftUI of launching the SDK capture flow on a button click:

```swift
import HVCaptureSDK 
import SwiftUI

struct FooView: View {
    let jobInfo: CaptureJobInformation
    let sessionSettings: HVCameraSettings

    // ... populate settings, etc. 

    var body: some View {
        Button("Start Capture") {
            let captureTask = Task {
                do {
                    try await HVPartnerSDK.sharedInstance.startCaptureSession(settings: sessionSettings, info: jobInfo)
                } catch let error as HVSessionError {
                    // maybe handle our known errors here
                    switch error.kind {
                    case .UserCancelled:
                        print("User cancelled capture flow")
                    case .FilesystemUnavailable:
                        print("File system is not writable?")
                    case .SessionCreationFailed:
                        print("Could not create capture session")
                    case .ViewControllerMissing:
                        print("View Controller absent")
                    case .Unknown(let errorMsg):
                        print("unknown error \(errorMsg)")
                    }
                    print("Known capture flow error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                } catch {
                    // unknown error, who knows what to do
                    print("Unknown Capture Flow Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                }
                captureSessionCompleted()
            }
        }
    }

    func captureSessionCompleted() {
        // perform any next steps for post-capture session work
    }
}
```

Note that the SDK executed asynchronously, and the task that calls ``startCaptureSession`` will suspend until the capture flow completes. As such, there's a very linear flow to interacting with the SDK, and once the call's `await` returns, the host app knows the SDK's capture session is complete (as seen with the `captureSessionCompleted` function above).

#### Cancelling a Capture Session

Since we execute asynchronously, within a Swift ``Task``, we also honor its cancellation functionality and stop the capture session and capture flow UI if the task is cancelled. 

```swift
let captureTask = Task {
    do {
        try await HVPartnerSDK.sharedInstance.startCaptureSession(settings: sessionSettings, info: jobInfo)
    } catch let error as HVSessionError {
        switch error.kind {
        case .UserCancelled:
            print("We've been cancelled!")
        }
    }
}

// You can cancel the task (and thereby, the capture flow + capture session) like this:
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 10, execute: {
    captureTask.cancel()
})
```
