## Overview

The HOVER Capture SDK provides on-device functionality to facilitate HOVER 3D model creation. Specifically, it provides:

- Sensor interaction for data acquisition 
- On-device data processing and transformation
- Visual elements and user guidance to guide data acquisition and improve captured data
- On-device local persistence
- Robust data uploads to the HOVER backend

Once the data has been captured and uploaded from the SDK, the HOVER backend will begin the 3D model processing.
